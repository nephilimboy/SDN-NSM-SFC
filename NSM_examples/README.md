# Examples

These examples create simple SFC scenarios with Kernel-type network interfaces. 
It's important to customize the middlebox images based on the specific use case. 
Additionally, if a packet forwarder isn't utilized, traffic routing within the 
middleboxes must be managed manually (in these example the application image in the middleboxes does not
perform any action on the packets. The user is free to use any customized Docker image).
